    abstract="We study the question of which optimization problems can beoptimally or approximately solved by``greedy'' or ``greedy-like'' algorithms. For definiteness, we limit the presentdiscussion to  some well-studied scheduling problems althoughthe underlying issues apply in a much more general setting.Of course, the main  benefit of greedy algorithmslies in both their conceptual simplicity and their computationalefficiency. Based on the experience from  onlinecompetitive analysis, it seems plausible that we shouldbe able to derive approximation bounds for ``greedy-like''algorithms exploiting only the conceptual simplicity of these algorithms.To this end, we need (and will provide) a precise definition of what we mean by greedy and greedy-like.",
